## Notes

Current Status: **NEARLY READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The system has most core components working, but requires:
1. Resolution of TensorFlow DLL loading issues
2. Completion of remaining documentation
3. Setting up proper monitoring and logging
4. Final integration testing with broker APIs

Estimated time to production readiness: 1-2 weeks
