# Fixing TensorFlow DLL Loading Issues on Windows

This guide provides solutions for the common TensorFlow DLL loading error on Windows systems.

## The Problem

When running the advanced AI trading strategy, you may encounter this error:

```
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _pywrap_tensorflow_internal
```

This typically happens because TensorFlow requires specific Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages that may be missing or incompatible with your system.

## Solution 1: Install the Correct Visual C++ Redistributable

1. Download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019:
   - [Download VC_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

2. Restart your computer after installation

3. Try running your TensorFlow code again

## Solution 2: Install a Compatible TensorFlow Version

Different versions of TensorFlow have different compatibility requirements. Try installing a specific version:

```bash
# Uninstall current TensorFlow
pip uninstall -y tensorflow

# Install a specific version known to work well on Windows
pip install tensorflow==2.10.0
```

## Solution 3: Use TensorFlow CPU-Only Version

If you're still having issues, try the CPU-only version which has fewer dependencies:

```bash
# Uninstall current TensorFlow
pip uninstall -y tensorflow

# Install CPU-only version
pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.10.0
```

## Solution 4: Check Python Compatibility

Ensure you're using a Python version compatible with TensorFlow:

- TensorFlow 2.10.0 works well with Python 3.8-3.10
- TensorFlow 2.6.0 works well with Python 3.6-3.9

```bash
# Check your Python version
python --version

# If needed, install a compatible Python version
# Then create a new virtual environment with that version
```

## Solution 5: Create a Clean Environment

Sometimes a clean installation in a fresh environment resolves dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv tf_env

# Activate the environment
tf_env\Scripts\activate

# Install TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow==2.10.0

# Install other required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Solution 6: Temporary Workaround

If you need to run the system while resolving the TensorFlow issue, you can use our simplified backtest that doesn't rely on ML models:

```bash
# Run the simplified backtest
python -m tests.test_simple_backtest --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-03-24 --output ./backtest_results
```

## Verifying the Fix

After applying any of these solutions, verify that TensorFlow is working correctly:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

If this runs without errors, TensorFlow is properly installed and you can now run the advanced strategy tests:

```bash
python -m tests.test_advanced_strategy
```
